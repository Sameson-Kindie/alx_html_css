          <h1> The 3 Different Types of Computers (with Examples) </h1>
            <h2>#1: Types of Computers by Use</h2>
              <p>Here, computers are classified depending on the intended use/application. By use, we have a general purpose and special purpose computers. All computers will fall into any of these two categories before they can be classified further. A general-purpose computer is programmed to undertake several tasks and interact with multiple devices or users. Most computers, including PCs, desktops, smartphones, and tablets, fall under this category because they can perform most computing tasks.This is a microprocessor-based computer programmed to perform a particular software-controlled task or set of functions. Still, they cannot perform other general functions of a computer. They are also referred to as embedded computers. They can be used in industrial automation, space exploration, and digital signage.

                Examples: Wi-Fi routers, automatic teller machines, dedicated gaming consoles, PlayStations, automatic vendor machines, robot vacuum cleaners, washing machines, etc.</p>
      
            <h2> #2: Types of Computers by Size/Power </h2>
               <p> Since their inception, computers have evolved into different sizes. A computer can be as huge as occupying a whole room or a large building and as small as a laptop or handheld device.This classification includes Supercomputers, Mainframecomputers, Minicomputers and Microcomputers</p>
      
            <h2>#3: Types of Computers by Handling Capabilities</h2>
                    <h3>Digital Computers</h3>
                      <p>These types of computers are designed to work on numerical data presented in the form of binary digits (0s and 1s). Thus, any input is usually converted into the binary language to enable the computer to process the data to produce information. They can compute mathematical calculations and also process logical/factual work.

                        Examples of digital computers include PCs, mobile phones, and tablets.</p>
                    <h3>Analog Computers</h3>
                      <p> 
                        As the name suggests, these types of computers are primarily designed to process and analyze organic (analog) measurable data. They donâ€™t process numerical data but, instead, data captured from the real world, such as distance, pressure, temperature, speed, and length.
                        
                        Examples include speedometers, thermometers, volt meters, calculators, and clocks.
                      </p>
                    <h3>Hybrid Computers</h3>
                      <p>A hybrid computer is a blend of both analog and digital computers. They are designed for fast and efficient computations of complex calculations and factual work. They are mainly used in medicine, whereby raw input data (analog data) is converted into digital signals and processed to produce a numerical output.

                        Examples include electrocardiogram machines, ultrasound machines, and gasoline vending machines.</p>
